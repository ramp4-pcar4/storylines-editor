This sector overview explores NPRI substances released, disposed, and transferred by this industry. It also summarizes what steps facilities in this sector take to mitigate their environmental impacts.\n\nBusinesses, institutions and other facilities across Canada must report their releases, transfers and disposals of pollutants to air, water and land annually to the Government of Canada's NPRI. The information collected is public, helps governments set environmental priorities and monitor environmental performance, and provides Canadians with an opportunity to learn about pollution in their surroundings.",

Bitumen does not flow easily at room temperature and requires unconventional methods to extract. Bitumen is extracted either from surface mining or in-situ using a variety of methods.\n\nThe choice between surface mining and thermal in-situ is solely determined by the depth of the oil deposit. Surface mining is used to reach deposits to a maximum depth of 70 meters below the surface; thermal in-situ wells extract bitumen at greater depths.\n\nSurface mining involves digging up large areas with large excavators. The resulting bitumen and sand mixture is mixed with hot water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to separate the bitumen. During this process, the bitumen rises to the top of large separation vessels as a froth. This froth bitumen is further processed in a froth treatment unit to extract the bitumen. Most of the material dug up in an oil sands surface mine is clay and sand. The bitumen extracted makes up about 10% of this material.",

This heats the bitumen to the point that it flows and can be brought up to the surface. If the bitumen has a low enough viscosity that it can be extracted using conventional methods, the in-situ operations do not need to use thermal methods to promote extraction. This sector overview addresses only those sites using thermal extraction methods, as they are much more energy-intensive.\n\nThermal in-situ facilities have a much smaller physical footprint than surface mining operations, and they do not produce tailings that need to be stored on-site. They also use significantly less water as compared to surface mining facilities. Thermal in-situ facilities are more energy intensive than mines, due to the production of steam. However, new technologies and industry research are focused on [reducing in-situ energy intensity](https://www.cosia.ca/initiatives/greenhouse-gases).",

Bitumen is usually too heavy and viscous to be pumped out from deep underground using conventional means and must be heated up before extraction. This heat is provided by injecting high pressure steam deep underground to heat up the bitumen so it can be pumped out of the ground.\n\nThere are various different methods for steam injection. Two of the primary methods used for in-situ extraction are Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). CSS uses one pipe drilled into the ground. Steam is injected and then the heated bitumen is pumped back up the same pipe. In this way, the well is cycled between injection and production. SAGD uses two drill holes that run horizontal after reaching the appropriate depth. Steam is injected into one pipe and the heated bitumen flows into and is pumped out of the other pipe. SAGD wells are able to continuously produce instead of being cycled between injection and production like CSS.\n\nCompared to surface mining, in-situ operations are much more energy intensive, as energy is required to create the steam that is injected. On the other hand, in-situ methods are much less disruptive to the natural habitat, as the operation has a much smaller footprint and the land does not have to be cleared to access the bitumen. In-situ facilities also do not produce tailings that need to be impounded and managed.",

The provinces have jurisdiction over oil and gas development within their provincial boundaries, and environmental protection is a shared responsibility by the Government of Canada and the provinces. The federal government participates in the environmental assessment process through the Joint Review Panel for proposed surface mine developments, while the Government of Alberta is responsible for the assessment of proposed in-situ developments.\n\nGovernments at all levels are committed to balancing economic benefits and environmental stewardship from the development of this sector. Oil sands projects undergo significant environmental assessments before they are approved and they are subject to extensive environmental monitoring throughout the project’s life. Please visit the **[Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Monitoring Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/oil-sands-monitoring.html)** for more information.\n\nWhile emissions of pollutants have risen from this sector as it has grown, the oil sands industry has been very successful in reducing its emissions per barrel of oil produced.\n\nOil sands surface mining facilities in Alberta take much of their water from the Athabasca River. The provincial government sets limits on how much water can be drawn, based on the season, through the **[Surface Water Quantity Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/9781460121733)**, which insures that annual withdrawals never exceed 3% of the river’s flow.",
