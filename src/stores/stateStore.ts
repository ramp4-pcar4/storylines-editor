/**
 * Handles state tracking functionality throughout the Storylines Editor.
 */

/**
 * HOW IT WORKS
 * 1. On initial load, the stateStore saves the loaded-in (or created) config as the
 *    "latest saved state" (latestSavedState).
 * 2. A change is made in a certain module (a panel editor, the metadata modal, etc.).
 *    The module "saves" the changes to the local 'configs' object (usually this.configs
 *    in the editor/metadata editor) and then either emits a "slide-edit" event, if inside
 *    a panel editor, or a "save-status" event in the slide editor or above (OR, if in the
 *    metadata editor already, the updateSaveStatus() function directly).
 * 3. The metadata editor (may be updated in the future) catches the event and calls the
 *    updateSaveStatus() function, if not already called in step 2.
 * 4. The function calls a debounced handlePotentialChange() function, which parses the
 *    local configs object for any differences from the latestSavedState. It creates
 *    a diff between the local configs object and the latestSavedState and determines
 *    if it is empty.
 *
 * > NOTE: Ensure that you only use handlePotentialChange() through the save-status/slide-edit
 *         event or updateSaveStatus(). Avoid calling it directly! The debouncing done in
 *         updateSaveStatus() may cause changes not to be saved properly.
 *
 * 5. Based on step 4, the function determines the value of isChanged, a boolean showing
 *    if any changes have been made from the latestSavedState. If the isChanged flag
 *    is changed, the app detects it via change-listeners and updates the "Unsaved Changes"
 *    indicator accordingly.
 * 6. A running "list of changes" stateChangesList is kept; handlePotentialChanges() adds
 *    the diff created in step 4 to this list, so long as it isn't the exact same as the
 *    current last item in stateChangesList.
 *
 * > NOTE: There's a maximum number of items that will be stored in stateChangesList
 *         (MAX_STATE_CHANGES); that number is currently set at 30. If that number is about
 *         to be exceeded, the first item in the list will be purged to make way for the
 *         new addition.
 *
 * 7. On save, the save() function is called, which updates the latestSavedState,
 *    deletes all items in the the stateChangesList, and resets the isChanged flag.
 *
 * > IN THE FUTURE: Functions like undo(), redo(), and reconcileAppState() will be used
 *   for undo/redo functionality (reconcileAppState is essentially meant to tell the app
 *   to refresh its config variables).
