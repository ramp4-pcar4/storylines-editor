The information collected is publicly available, and can help Governments set environmental priorities and monitor environmental performance. Canadians can also use this information to learn about pollution in their environment.  

Ethylene glycol is a chemical substance notably used in industrial processes to remove ice or as anti-freeze liquid. In Canada, it is most commonly used by airports during airplane de-icing operations in winter. 

This substance overview explores the total quantities of Ethylene Glycol reported to the NPRI by various industries across Canada. It also summarizes the actions taken by reporting facilities to mitigate their environmental impacts.`,

- As a component of ice-removing and anti-freeze fluid, and
- In the manufacture of plastics (i.e., polyethylene terephthalate or PET), which can then be converted into numerous products, such as bottles and textiles.

However, based on estimated exposure levels for 2010, the Government of Canada concluded that ethylene glycol was not harmful to the health of the general population ([reference final assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/publications/ethylene-glycol-final-content.html) and [state of the science report](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/reports-publications/environmental-contaminants/canadian-environmental-protection-act-1999-priority-substances-list-assessment-report-ethylene-glycol.html)).

Nevertheless, exposure to high levels or concentrations of ethylene glycol could lead to [different symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750031.html). If ingested at high doses, ethylene glycol could have impacts on human health, including the effects on the nervous system, blood, digestive system, heart, lungs and kidneys. Untreated ethylene glycol poisoning could be fatal. Contact with skin could burn or irritate. Inhalation could cause irritation of the nose and throat and long-term exposure may harm the respiratory system.`,

                    content: `Once released into the environment, ethylene glycol is mainly found in surface water and groundwater. It does not accumulate or persist in the environment, primarily due to naturally occurring degradation that is the breakdown of materials by bacteria, fungi or other biological organisms. 

The substance only causes adverse effects in organisms at high doses or concentrations and has been found to degrade rapidly in the aquatic environment. The rapid degradation of ethylene glycol has the potential to reduce the levels of oxygen in receiving waters, which can affect organisms.  However, because 96% of ethylene glycol declared to the NPRI is primarily released during winter and the early spring months, the risk to waterbodies can be mitigated by the increased water flow. 

The rapid degradation, low concentrations in terms of toxicity, seasonality of releases and the fact that it does not accumulate in the environment or in organisms makes this substance unlikely to pose significant risk to the environment at the current levels in Canada.`,

Overall, total releases of ethylene glycol have increased between 2010 and 2019, with some annual variability, as shown in figure 3 below. With the airport and services to airport sector accounting for nearly all the releases, the annual variability can be explained by variations in winter temperatures, as colder winters would call for more de-icing operations. The general upward trend can be explained by increases in air transportation through time. In 2017, Canadian air carriers reported an increase in passengers (7.6%) and fuel consumption (4%) from 2016, which correlates with the upward trend of ethylene glycol reported to the NPRI.`,

                    content: `Although air releases only account for a very small fraction of reported releases of ethylene glycol through time (less than 1% for 2019), the chemicals sector shows a significant increase (130 tonnes, or 531% increase) from 2015 to 2016, and has remained constant since then. However, in 2019 there is a significant decrease for the chemicals sector.  Compared to the overall amount of ethylene glycol releases in Canada, the total amount of ethylene glycol released to the air by the chemicals sector remains low.

As for water releases, we are seeing an overall decreasing trend, driven by decreases in reported releases by the oil and gas sector from offshore oil platforms.`,

The sector showing the most variability is the waste management sector as these facilities typically experience a lot of variation depending of type of material that they receive, which may change from year to year (as shown by the orange line in figure 5).

When examining disposals and recycling separately, we can see that disposals have remained fairly constant while recycling has slightly increased over time. In the mid-1990’s, new guidelines for releases concentrations of ethylene glycol in water were established by Transport Canada and Fisheries and Ocean Canada. All Canadian airports put in place new operational procedures to implement remediation work. The increase in recycling and treatment indicates a positive change, as it significantly reduce the amount of substance that would otherwise end up in landfills and environments.

In the report, the Government concluded that:
- Ethylene glycol is not expected to remain in the environment for a long time or accumulate in organisms;
- The quantity released to the environment is below the level expected to cause harm to organisms and is not entering the environment in a quantity or under conditions that constitute a danger to the environment; and, 
- It is not harmful to the health of the general population at current levels of exposure.

- Energy conservation;
- Water conservation.
